        %p To halt climate change, we need to start capturing the millions of tons of CO2 pouring out of the world’s electricity plants. So far, most of the focus has been on pumping the CO2 back underground, to bind with rocks. But why not just stash it in the cement used to make sidewalks...

    %h3 Common Questions
    .double_content_border
    %h4.title What's a Tip?
    %p.alt-spotus Anyone can create a news "tip" about an important topic you think should be reported on? This is often related to the question "what are you passionate about?" You can pledge to this tip, but no money is taken - it's just a way to show how much interest you have in this possibly becoming a pitch (link to pitch Faq). Creating a tip could be the spark that starts an investigation.

    %h4.title What do you mean "Pledge?"
    %br/ 
    %p.alt-spotus Pledges do not represent an actual money transaction. But, they do show the general monetary value that a story might command. When you "pledge" a tip, it's similar to joining a group. If a journalist references this tip in their pitch, you'll be notified and asked to DONATE real money at that point.

    %h4.title What happens next?
