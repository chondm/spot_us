  %h3 Common Questions
  .double_content_border
  %h4.title What's a Tip?
  %p.alt-spotus 
    Anyone can create
    = link_to "a news tip about an important topic", page_path("about", :anchor => "faq_citizen")
    you think should be reported on? This is often related to the question "what are you
    passionate about?" You can pledge to this tip, but no money is taken -
    it's just a way to show how much interest you have in this possibly
    becoming a pitch. Creating a tip could be the spark
    that starts an investigation.

  %h4.title What do you mean "Pledge?"
  %p.alt-spotus 
    = link_to "Pledges do not represent an actual money transaction.", page_path("about", :anchor => "faq_citizen")
    But, they do show the general monetary value that a story might command. When you "pledge"
    a tip, it's similar to joining a group. If a journalist references this
    tip in their pitch, you'll be notified and asked to DONATE real money at
    that point.

  %h4.title What happens next?
  %p.alt-spotus 
    We gather a group of supporters and if a reporter is inspired to build a pitch
    from this tip we will let you know!
