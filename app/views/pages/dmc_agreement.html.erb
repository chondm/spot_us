  <h2>What is Spot.Us About?</h2>
  <p>
    Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</p>
  <p>
    Notice And Takedown Procedure As part of our compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright
    Act (DMCA), we must respond to clear notices of copyright infringement provided by other
    parties. This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is
    designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to Spot.Us as straightforward as
    possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult
    to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form
    suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site,
    http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions
    as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    We expect that all users of any part of the Spot.Us site will comply with applicable copyright
    laws. However, if Spot.Us receives proper notiﬁcation of claimed copyright infringement, we
    reserve the right to remove or disable access to material claimed to be infringing and/or to
    terminate subscribers (although the latter will usually be only for repeat infringers),
    regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws
    of another jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt
    to contact the author of the content so that they may make a counter-notiﬁcation pursuant to
    Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on
    which we act.
  </p>
  <p>

    the DMCA is:
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email Address</li>
    <li>Physical Mail Address</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Upon receipt of proper notiﬁcation of claimed infringement, Spot.Us will follow the procedures
    outlined here and in the DMCA.
  </p>

  <p>  
    Counter-notiﬁcation 
  </p>
  <p>  
    If you are the author of content that is subject to a claim of infringement, you may make a

    counter-notiﬁcation with us, please provide Spot.Us’ Registered Agent (listed above) with the
    following information in writing (preferably via email):

    <li>
     Your signature, in physical or electronic form.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    After we receive this counter-notiﬁcation, Spot.Us will promptly provide the person who
    submitted the original infringement notiﬁcation with a copy of the counter-notiﬁcation, and will
    inform that person that Spot.Us will replace the removed material or restore access to it in 10
    business days. Spot.Us will replace the removed material and restore access to it not less than
    10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter-notice, unless our
    Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement
    notiﬁcation that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the
    subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeat Infringers In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, Spot.Us will, in
    appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat
    infringers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Accommodation Of Standard Technical Measures It is Spot.Us’ policy to accommodate and not
    interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect
    copyrighted works that Spot.Us determines are reasonable under the circumstances.
