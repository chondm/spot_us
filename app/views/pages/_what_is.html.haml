  %a{:name => "faqtip"}
  %h3 How Do I Suggest A Story?
  %p
    Anyone can "suggest a story" about an important topic you think should be reported on. This is
    often related to the question "what are you passionate about?" You can pledge to this tip, but
    no money is taken - it’s just a way to show how much interest you have in this possibly becoming
    a pitch. Suggesting a story could be the spark that starts an investigation. To suggest a story
    just create an account and click "Suggest a Story."    
    
  %a{:name => "finished_content_citizens"}
  %h3 What Happens To The Finished Content?
  %p
    Finished content is published on Spot.Us unless we are working with a partnering organization.
    Spot.Us works with local news organizations to get content distributed in as many places as
    possible. See our growing list of 
    = link_to 'media partners.', page_path("examples")
    Our partner news organizations can also obtain temporary copyright to the content (first
    publishing rights) if they donate 50% or more towards a pitch. Extra proceeds go back to
    community members who originally supported that pitch. We always ensure that the content will be
    made available online.

  %a{:name => "join_the_team"}
  %h3 What are Assignments, How Can I Take One Up?
  %p
    Spot.Us believes that some projects benefit through collaboration. If a reporter wants, they can
    create "Assignments" and invite the public to help them out. Some assignments lend themselves to
    lots of help, others just need one or two people. You can view and apply for all assignments
    under the "assignment" tab of a pitch. When you apply for an assignment a message is sent to the
    reporter that you are intersted in helping out with the reporting. If the reporter approves you
    taking on the assignment, you'll be notified via email and receive access to the pitch's "story
    updates" so you can show the reporter and the world what you have dug up. Not all stories
    benefit through collaboration, so joining the reporting team is done on a case by case basis by
    the reporter who is in charge of the pitch.
        
  %a{:name => "donation_goal"}
  %h3 What If The Pitch I Donate To Doesn't Reach Its Goal?
  %p
    All credits are returned to your account and you can direct them towards any other existing
    pitch. You will have until the end of the fiscal year to put the money back in circulation
    through the Spot.Us system.
  %p
    In the future we hope to build out a more dynamic credit system such that credit
    cards are only charged if the specific pitch you want has reached its funding goal.
    
  %a{:name => "thereporters"}
  %h3 Who Are These Reporters?
  %p
    Reporters on Spot.Us are self-identified freelance journalists. We do speak with every reporter
    about their pitch and verify their identity. As a marketplace we will continue to build tools to
    enable you to find out more about these reporters and judge them on the merits of their work.
    But it is important to note that Spot.Us does not try to define who is and is not a
    "journalist." What we say is that "we are choosy but not exclusive." We have worked with a two
    time Pulitzer Prize winning reporter. We've also worked with two high school students. The
    students had to convince us they were up to the challenge and were transparent about their lack
    of experience. Any self-identified freelancer can work with us and if they are earnest, we will
    reciprocate. We do require transparency about a reporters experience. We encourage every citizen
    to view the reporters profile and pitch critically before you donate.
  
  %a{:name => "priceguide"}
  %h3 How Are Prices For Each Pitch Determined?
  %p
    As a marketplace Spot.Us is continually updating its 
    = link_to 'pricing guildines.', page_path("reporter_agreement") 
    We have built this guidline as a means to explain how much a reporter can reasonable ask for
    during an investigation. It is based on competitive rates throughout the country for
    freelancers.
    
  %a{:name => "privacy"}
  %h3 Your Privacy
  %p
    Privacy is very important to us. We will never share your information with a third party without
    your EXPRESS permission. No if’s and’s or but’s. To learn more, please check our

  %h3 Agreement To Work With Spot.Us And Pricing Guidlines.
  %p
    We've created a pricing guidline based on competitive rates for freelancers. This also includes
    the "reporters agreement" that explains the working relationship between Spot.Us and the
    reporter. The most important thing to know is that we are flexible. We work for you, so if you
    have special requests, speak up!
  %p

  %a{:name => "pitch_advice"}
  %h3 Advice On Creating A Pitch
  %p
    Write the pitch so that anyone who reads it will want to see that story materialize. Sell your
    idea and your expertise on the subject. Don’t be afraid to be personal. Upload a YouTube or Vimeo video
    explaining who you are and why you’re the right person for the job. Imagine what civic leaders
    or organizations would want to partner with you. Remember - the public now has a freelance
    budget, pitch them like you would the editor of a major metropolitan newspaper.

  %a{:name => "qa_editor"}
  %h3 What’s The Role Of The Peer-Review Editor?
  %p
    The Peer-Review editor has three main responsibilities – to ensure fair and accurate reporting,
    to be a second pair of eyes before a story is published as a sounding board for the
    reporter. To do the latter the Peer-Review editor should be in touch with the
    journalist regularly. At any time the Peer-Review
    editor can report suspicious activities to Spot.Us. If Spot.Us is partnering with an existing news organization then they provide editorial oversight. Otherwise Peer-Review editors are assigned by spot.Us,
    and the reporter can reject the first two assigned editors. The investigation will not publish
    without the Peer-Review editor's approval. Any journalist can apply to be a Peer-Review editor
    by applying for that "Assignment."
    
  %a{:name => "joined_the_team"}
  %h3 What are Assignments and How Can I Use Them?
  %p
    After creating a pitch, a reporter can create an "Assignmnet." These are not required, but at
    Spot.Us we believe that the public can help power reporting in a few ways. One ways is by
    donating funds. Another is when the public donates time. The more specific your assignments are,
    the more likely you will get positive results. You can create an assignment to get photography.
    You can create an assignment to have people look over documents. You can even create an
    assignment to have people conduct interviews. When people apply for an assignment you'll be
    notified and it's up to you if they are assigned or not. If assigned, they'll have access to
    your pitch's blog and can turn in their assignments through "story updates." This feature is entirely under your control.
    
  %a{:name => "finished_content_reporters"}
  %h3 What Happens To The Finished Content?
  %p
    There is no set flow chart for what happens to the finished content. It might be published on
    Spot.Us' site. If we are working with a partner organization, they might publish it as well. A
    reporter is always notified about potential partnerships and it's ther decision to move forward
    with them or not. The reporter is always given attribution for their work. It is not allowed to
    be altered without the author's express permission. If there are no partnering organizations,
    the content is made free to be republished through a Creative Commons license.
  %p 
    Next time an editor rejects your piece purely for monetary reasons, suggest raising
    half of your freelance salary on Spot.Us. Spot.Us is happy if you upload pitches to our site and
    try to shop them around to news organizations at the same time under the condition that
    interested news organizations work with the Spot.Us community.
  
  %a{:name => "pitch_goal"}
  %h3 What If My Pitch Doesn’t Reach its Goal?
  %p
    You can accept to do the pitch regardless of whether or not you reach the original goal. So, if
    you raise 80% of the stated goal, you can still accept that money, but you must do what was
    outlined in the original pitch. You can also choose to cancel the pitch at any time and
    donations will be directed back to the original donors in the form of credits so they may direct
    it to another pitch.
  %P    
    In the future we will have a more dynamic credit card system that will only charge a users
    credit cards upon the succesful acceptance of a pitch.

  %a{:name => "creative_commons"}
  %h3 What’s The Creative Commons Deal?
  %p
    The end content produced by Spot.Us will be given away for free unless a news organization has
    contributed either 50% or more of the total costs or has provided in-kind contributions
    throughout the project. In that situation - we will grant that news organization temporary
    copyright to the article. If we are not working with a specific news organization we will try
    and get the content published by as many sources as possible. To do so, we use a Creative
    Commons license (attribution, no derivites). You can learn more by reading our
    = link_to 'Reporters Contract', page_path("reporter_contract")

  %a{:name => "approval"}
  %h3 Why Do We Need Approval To Get Started?
  %p
    News organizations have a special role in Spot.Us. They are the only type of user that is
    allowed to donate MORE than 20% of a pitch's goal. As such, we filter news organizations to ensure
    they ascribe to journalistic ethics as described by the Society of Professional Journalists. We
    realize that a waiting period before you become a "news organization" on Spot.Us is less than
    ideal, but it is important to us that these ethics are followed by anybody that could
    singlehandedly fund an investigation. Feel free to email
    = mail_to "info@spot.us", nil, :encode => "hex"
    if you have questions. We tend to approve accounts within 24 hours.    

  %a{:name => "work_with"}
  %h3 Advice On Working With Spot.Us. How To Bolster Your Freelance Budget.
  %p
    Spot.Us is an opportunity to bolster your freelance budget by working with and for the public.
    We only work with freelancers, we cannot support staff writers (this may change for nonprofit
    news organizations). But if you do work or want to procure freelance work, perhaps part of their
    wage can be shared with the public. You can donate 50% of their freelance salary upfront and the
    Spot.Us community can fundraise the other 50%. Your organization will still get first publishing
    rights. Or you can register on Spot.Us and find out about high quality articles that have been
    100% community funded, so the reporting comes from a profesional reporter, but you can run the
    content for free.
  %p
  %strong Here Are Various Ways Your Organization Can Get Involved
    
  %ul
    %li
      Spot.Us content that is 100% community funded is made available for free to news organizations
      to republish. Register on the site and we'll let you know when content is going to be published.
    %li
      Donate 50% of the value of an investigation and you'll get exclusive rights. (This is only
      available until the investigation has reached 51% funding through community donations, so get
      in the game early).
    %li
      Donate 100% of the value of an investigation and you'll get exclusive rights. You can do this
      at any time - all extra proceeds will be given back to community members to invest in another
      pitch. This is a way to build a new relationship with your audience. They'll love you for
      refunding them and it's a built in audience.
    %li
      We encourage you to donate small amounts as well. Even a tiny donations from a news
      organization can be the push to give a pitch the momentum it needs to get community funding -
      and you are welcome to the final content or even to apply as a peer-review editor.

  %p
    SO MUCH!!!
  %p
    We have lots planned. Our website is currently 1/4th of what we envision. As we
    develop the open source code we want to add the ability for journalists to report on their
    pitches in public on the Spot.Us site. We will add more functionality for all three types of
    users (citizen, reporter, news organization) and who knows what else we might cook up along the
    way. We are responsive to you, so your feedback is welcome.

  %h2 Why Are You Focused On Just The Bay Area And Los Angeles? 
  %hr/
  %p
    We do hope to eventually expand into other regions of the country. We are committed to local
    journalism for many reasons which we could talk your ear off about. As such, the Bay Area seemed
    like a great place to launch our 1.0 and we expanded into LA. As we improve the site we will
    launch in other cities.

    Changing a Pledge. You can change a pledge or donation at any time. For a tip, just find the
    pledge in your dashboard and make the change. For a donation, if you increase the donation
    you’ll have to “checkout” again – if you lower your donation, you’ll have spare credits which
    you can direct to a different pitch (spreading the love).
    
    Why Credits? Spot Credits are yours and they will remain in your control until a pitch of your
    choosing reaches its fundraising goal. All of the money you donate will go to the reporting
    needed to finish an investigation – Spot.Us also asks for tips to the organization, but it is not
    required and we are transparent in asking for tips. In the future we will be looking into
    options outside of credits to pay for investigative reporting – but for this version, it is the
    best way to get the job done.
    
    Why Tell a Friend? Spot.Us is about giving groups a new sense of editorial power. The only way
    an investigation gets funded is if a group or network sees value in it. If you are a
    civic-leader, you can take ownership of a tip or pitch by spreading word about it and making it
    a reality.
    
    What’s an RSS feed? RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. That means instead of you having
    to visit spot.us to find out what is new – we will send updates directly to your RSS reader. If
    you’re brand new to RSS, try Google Reader, it’s simple to use. Get your Google Reader up and
    running – then come back and click this funny orange button. FAQ for Reporters
    
    What’s a Reporters Notebook? A reporters notebook allows the QA editor and reporter to
    converse. It also allows a reporter to upload any reporting they’ve done while working on the
    larger investigation. The reporter can make this reporting public or private, but Spot.Us
    encourages transparency at all levels.
    
    Why give extra to spot.us? (also for Right coloumn of Profile View) Spot.Us is an exciting
    nonprofit project to pioneer “community funded reporting.” We believe journalism is a process –
    not a product and all we want to do is support good local investigative journalism. While we do
    everything to keep our overhead low, just accepting donations means we are running at a loss.
    Credit card companies take a small percentage of every transaction. We are trying to cover that
    cost ourselves but as a small nonprofit, we hope you will help us keep the lights on with a
    small donation that goes to the organization to recoup this loss.
