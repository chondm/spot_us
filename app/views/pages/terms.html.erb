  <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <p>
  Welcome to Spot.Us – a nonprofit project of the Center for Media Change that is trying to pioneer
  &ldquo;community powered reporting.&rdquo; We believe journalism is a process, not a product and
  that the process should be participatory. We have tried to create a marketplace that enables news
  organizations, independent reporters and community members to come together and collaborate on
  meaningful journalism. Independent reporters create &ldquo;pitches&rdquo; that outline
  journalistic work they intend to fulfill and a specific fundraising goal. Community members donate
  time or money towards reporting projects. News organizations can also donate to pitches, run the
  final content for free or get exclusive rights to the content by buying an ownership stake in a
  pitch. The refunded money can only be used to support more journalism, so while donors never
  receive cash back, they are able to donate towards two works of journalism for the price of one.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our site is all about community and trust. We prefer to keep things informal, but we are also told
  terms of service is necessary for both you and us. So, this is our terms of service page. Please
  check it out.
  </p>
  <h3>
  2. The Agreement

  transactions between you and Spot.Us (the "Services"). By using the Website, you agree to be bound

  "Program").
  </p>
  <p>
  Spot.Us may change the Agreement from time to time, at Spot.Us&rsquo; sole discretion. Your
  continued use of this website following the posting of such changes will constitute your assent to
  all such changes. Please periodically visit this section of the site to review the current version
  of the Agreement. This provision is included because we are a nonprofit startup and still getting
  our feet on the ground; we have no intention of making sweeping changes.

  </p>
  <h3> 3. Participation In The Program</h3>
 
  <p>
  Spot.Us is a marketplace where independent journalists can pitch the public for small donations
  that can add up to fund an investigation into work that will benefit the public. The marketplace
  is set up so that a &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; from a reporter acts as a contract. In the contract a
  reporter sets a target fundraising goal. Spot.Us cannot guarantee that the fundraising goal will
  be met. Spot.Us makes no warranty or guarantee of performance on behalf of the reporters whose
  projects are promoted on this site.
  </p>
  <p>
  By participating in the Program or otherwise using the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree
  that (a) Spot.Us makes no representation as to whether the finished content will meet your
  specific demands. Rather we work to make sure the final content meets the requirements laid out by
  the reporters. We make efforts to ensure that every project is completed but take no
  responsibility on behalf of the reporters. (b) Donations made via the Website may be returned as
  &ldquo;credits&rdquo; to the user in the case that a &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; is unsuccessful in
  reaching its target goal, but we will not reimburse actual U.S. dollars. (As a small startup
  nonprofit, we simply can&rsquo;t afford that kind of regular transaction). YOU ASSUME TOTAL
  RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR DONATIONS&rsquo;S MADE THROUGH THIS SITE.
  </p>
  <p>
  You understand that any and all decisions made by you with respect to the Program are yours alone.
  Spot.Us cannot and does not verify the accuracy of information in pitches, but does allow users to
  investigate the reporters who produce them. Donors furthermore acknowledge that journalism may not
  adhere to exact production schedules defined in project descriptions and that on some occasions
  projects may change in scope or direction while underway. Spot.Us will not make any refunds of
  donations to donors for any reason other than inaccurately entered donation amounts or recipients,
  which must be reported within five business days of the donation to qualify for a refund.
  </p>
  <h3> 3.1. Donation Distribution</h3>
  <p>
  You understand that every pitch is assigned an independent &ldquo;peer review editor&rdquo; who
  receives 10% of the money raised or is otherwise a volunteer. These are not Spot.Us employees, but
  other independent contractors. The remaining 90% of the money goes to the reporter. Spot.Us will
  not take any of this money, but does ask for additional contributions to be made towards its
  operational costs.
  </p>
  <h3> 3.2. Tax Deductibility</h3>  
  <p>
  You understand that Spot.Us is a project of the non-profit Center for Media Change which has
  received an exemption from the Internal Revenue Service as an organization that qualifies as a
  public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time
  to time. Your donations are tax-deductible, but you are solely responsible for determining the
  proper tax treatment for any donation you make through the Services and the Program. Spot.Us will
  not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any donation you might make.
