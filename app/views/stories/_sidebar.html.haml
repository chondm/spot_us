%h4.title How Much Should I ask for?"
%br/ 
%p.alt-spotus 
  Be reasonable and make sure you can justify your request. As you prove your journalistic integrity
  you can ask for more in your second pitch. You can also accept the pitch at any time, even if you
  haven't reached your fundraising goal. Feel free to ask a news organization to split the bill with
  the Spot.Us community.
