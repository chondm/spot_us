Dear <%=@pitch.user.first_name%>,

Someone wants to join your pitch's reporting team:

<%= @pitch.headline %>
<%= pitch_url(@pitch) %>

What does this mean?


They want to help you report. If you have small research tasks, photo needs, etc.
this might be a good way to distribute some of the workload.

Some stories lend themselves to collaboration and others don't. If you want to brainstorm ideas
or want to find out more about the person that applied to join your reporting team
contact Spot.Us.

You can read more here: http://spot.us/pages/about#joined_the_team

Spot.Us: <info@spot.us> or David Cohn <david@spot.us>

Sincerely,
The Spot.Us Team.
