Dear <%= @pitch.user.first_name %>,

Congrats! Your pitch has been approved!

It will be on the home page of Spot.Us shortly.

Here are some fundraising ideas.

1. Get folks that you know are friendly to your project and efforts and have them contribute first. If we have a sponsored survey up, they can donate for free! Language about that is below.
2. Once you have some friendly faces already donated - reach out to a larger audience via Twitter and Facebook. Remember though - an earnest email is always the best way to reach out. 
3. Consider creating an "incentive" - just go to your pitch and click "add incentive." These are rewards you will give to high end donors. The "free credits" feature appeals to low end donors, the 'incentives' appeal to high end donors.

Here's some language we often use.

Dear TK
Personal Hello.
As you might know we are working on a reporting project (Your title here) about TK (SHORT)
It's something we are very passionate about and now with less than 2 minutes and 4 clicks you can help fund this reporting project!

(NOTE: if we have a sponsorship up - point out how the contribution can be FREE to them.)

Here are the simple steps to help our reporting project.
1. Go to our pitch at: http://spot.us/YOUR PITCH URL  
2. Click the large button that says "Free Credits" or "Fund This" on the right. You'll have to register/login. 
3. Take the quick questionnaire or contribute via credit card or paypal.
4. On the check out page - make sure everything adds up right, applying your credits or how much it will bill you.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for another survey or pass steps 1-4 along to others.

Thank you, thank you.
Signed - TK
