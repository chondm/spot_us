Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Hello from Spot.Us. 

Looks Like Something Went Wrong. It appears that you started the donation process to support a pitch but it didn't come through.

Could this be our fault? Completing your tax-deductible contribution is quick and simple. Just log into Spot.Us and go here: <%= edit_myspot_donations_amounts_path %>
You can also find this by logging in and clicking on the image of the shopping cart.

With your support we can make sure that important, but overlooked stories are finally told.

Sincerely,
The Spot.Us Team

Note: To stop receiving this notification, log into your account at Spot.Us, click "purchase" in the top left hand corner and either complete or remove the contribution.
