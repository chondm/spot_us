Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Thanks for applying to join this pitch's reporting team!

<%= @pitch.slug? %>
<%= pitch_url(@pitch) %>

What does this mean? 

Some stories can be works of collaboration. It is up to the reporter
to determine what, if any, help they might need to improve the story. 
If they have ideas on how you can help - we will let you know and then you can
"join the reporting team."

Once approved - you'll be able to write on the group blog for everyone to see
the reporting you are doing to help push the story forward.

You can read more here: http://spot.us/pages/about#join_the_team

You'll receive an email when you are approved.

Sincerely,
Spot.Us
