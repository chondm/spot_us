Dear <%=@to%>,

The pitch on Spot.Us is a success!!!!!!  Congrats!!!!

<%= @pitch.headline %>
<%= pitch_url(@pitch) %>

The work isn't done though. Now the reporter and the peer-review editor
are going to work together to do the actual reporting.

You can watch this happen by keeping your eye on the original pitch
page, especially the blog and comment sections.

Click "join the reporting team" if you want to help out in the reporting.

We will let you know when this reporting has been turned into a real
story. In the meantime, we will also try and partner with local news
organizations to publish the final investigation, possibly even
recouping you some of your original donation.

If you have any questions - don't hesitate to contact us:  info@spot.us

Sincerely,
David Cohn
