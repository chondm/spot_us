Dear <%=@user.first_name%>,

Thank you for your interest in joining Spot.Us.  We apologize for the
slight delay that you will experience in getting this status.

That is because news organizations are given special privileges on our
site, like the ability to donate large amounts towards pitches, and we
want to ensure that this ability is given to organizations that uphold
the ethics of journalism as described by the Society of Professional
Journalists.

To help us in this effort - please send an email to info@spot.us with
some additional information about your news organization. Once we receive
this and have a chance to look over your site we will move forward and get you
up and running on Spot.Us!!!

This usually takes less than 24 hours. It's even faster if you email info@spot.us

If you want - feel free to sign up as a "citizen" or "reporter," but use a different email address.

Sincerely,
Spot.Us Team - David Cohn
