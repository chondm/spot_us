Dear <%=@user.full_name%>,

Thanks for creating a pitch on Spot.Us. Please note that the pitch is not live yet. But you can find it and edit it by going to the <%=link_to @pitch.slug?, pitch_path(@pitch, {:only_path=>false})%> (you can find it in your dashboard in your user profile) and clicking "edit pitch." 

The pitch will not go live until it is approved by Spot.Us administration. We will contact you shortly with ideas on fundraising, how to tighten the pitch, etc. 

Once the pitch is up on Spot.Us - we work for you! Our goal is just to give you a solid footing. 

If you want - feel free to get the process started by emailing info@spot.us

Sincerely,

David Cohn
Spot.Us
