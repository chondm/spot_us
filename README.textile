h2. Community Funded Reporting

"Spot Us" is a project of the nonprofit "Center for Media Change":http://www.centerformediachange.com/ that allows an individual or group to take control of news by sharing the cost ("crowdfunding":http://crowdfunding.pbwiki.com/) to commission freelance journalists. Spot.Us is "made possible":http://newschallenge.org/spot_journalism by the Knight Foundation. "Read more":http://blog.spot.us/about-spot-us/.

Spot.Us won't be ready until the Fall - but we've received lots of interest. So we've "launched a wiki":http://wiki.spot.us/ to capture ideas and test the concept of "community funded reporting" in Northern California's Bay Area.

We are looking to partner with news organizations, freelance journalists and civic leaders in the Bay Area. Don't hesitate to "contact us":http://spot.us/contact.


h2.  How does Spot.Us work?

# An individual or journalist creates a pitch that outlines an untold story in a local community.
# Members of your community vote, with their money, on what stories are most important to them.
# A journalist researches the facts and puts together an article. Editors provide check-and-balance on the story.
# Spot.Us publishes the story in its news feeds and works with local media outlets to have the articles published more widely.

h2. Setting Up Spot.Us

h3. Setup configuration files

Make any necessary edits to these if the defaults don't work for you. Spot.Us is dependent on MySQL because it uses the rand() function.

# cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
# cp config/newrelic.example.yml config/newrelic.yml
# cp config/settings.example.yml config/settings.yml

h3. Run basic setup tasks

# rake db:create:all
# rake db:migrate
# rake db:populate

h3. Start your local server

# ./script/server

Spot.Us should now be running on your computer at the URL "http://spotus.local:3000":http://spotus.local:3000
